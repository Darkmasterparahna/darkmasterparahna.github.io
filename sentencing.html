        <p class="grey">To simplify the chart above: 
            To begin there has to be a young person who broke the law. 
            After they are accused of breaking the law, the police officer can either choose to charge or not to charge him.
        </p>
        <p class="green">If they choose to not charge him, they will give him a warning and send a letter to their parents</p>
        <p class="red">Otherwise, if the crime is serious or there are other circumstances they will go to court.</p>
        <p class="red">They will then go to a Judge where they will get a sentence. Such as Community service or counselling</p>
