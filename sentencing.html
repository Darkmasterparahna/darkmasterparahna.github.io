            <p class="process-s-explanation">The YCJA sentencing process seems very long and confusing but thats only because they need to take into account the different circumstances for each person.
                However, it is not as complicated as it seems.
                <br/> <br/>
                If I were to simplify this process, I would say that if a young person gets charged for a crime and is serious they will go to court.
                They will be unable to be charged for adult sentences however and will most likely recieve something like community service or counselling.
                <br/> <br/>
                If they do not get charged for the crime, the young person will get a warning or will be given a meaningful program based on their crime like community volunteering or with mental health workers.
                Once they are done, they will not recieve a criminal record or anything like that. If they don't finish the program they will have to go to court and recieve a judging as mentioned earlier.

            <img src="https://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/csj-sjc/just/img/outline.jpg" class="p-image">
            <p class="process-s-explanation">
                This is the Criminal Code of Canada's Justice Process. It seems much more straightforward but it usually ends up with the person having to go to court. If they are deemed guilty by the court then they will usually face incarceration or jail time. Neither of which really improves the person's overall attitude towards recognizing what they did wrong.
