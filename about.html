                The YCJA which stands for the Youth Criminal Justice Act is a law that governs Canada's justice system for youth. It applies to those who are at least 12 years old but under 18 with alleged or those who have supposedly committed criminal offences.
                <br />
                <br />
                In total there have been three different Youth Criminal Justice Acts and a set of the current YCJA was adopted by Parliament in 2012. This document is used to explain the background of the YCJA and to give a summary of its main purposes and the reasons behind them.
