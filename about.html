                About the YCJA
            </h1>
            <p1>
                The YCJA which stands for the Youth Criminal Justice Act is a law that governs Canada's justice system for youth. It applies to those who are at least 12 years old but under 18 with alleged or those who have supposedly committed criminal offences.
                <br />
                <br />
                In total there have been three different Youth Criminal Justice Acts and a set of the current YCJA was adopted by Parliament in 2012. This document is used to explain the background of the YCJA and to give a summary of its main purposes and the reasons behind them.
            </p1>
            <h1>Fun Fact</h1>
            <p>Anne McLellan was Canada's minister of justice when the YCJA was passed. She helped to write and defend it in the House of Commons.

            <h1>Youth Rights</h1>
            <p>
                The youth get different rights as compared to adults because of their age and their maturity level. 
                <br /><br />
                They have the right to their parents or guardians. They have the right to know why they are getting arrested. They can remain silent and talk to their parents in private. They also have the rights to contact their parents during questioning.
            </p>
            <br /><br /><br />
            <h1>Adult Rights</h1>
            <p>
                The adults get different rights as compared to the youth as they are under the criminal code of Canada and should know better than to commit the crime.
                <br /><br />
                Some rights include their right to freedom of thought, the right to understanding whats happening around them, and the right to protection against all forms of neglect, cruelty, abuse, exploitation, humiliation, retaliation and ridicule.
